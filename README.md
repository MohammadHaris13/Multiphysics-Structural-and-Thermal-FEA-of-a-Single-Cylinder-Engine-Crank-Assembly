# 4-Cylinder-Engine-Crank-Mechanism-Multiphysics-FEA
Comprehensive multiphysics FEA of a parametrically modeled single-cylinder engine crank assembly. Simulated in ANSYS Workbench (Static Structural, Thermal, Transient) with CAD geometry from SolidWorks/Inventor. Evaluated stress, deformation, and heat transfer for design optimization.
